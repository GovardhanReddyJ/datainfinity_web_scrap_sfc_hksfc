The extraction process involves scraping publicly available data from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) licensee database on Webb-site using the Firecrawl API.
The tool fetches firm and licensee details, including individual names, SFC IDs, roles, license periods, and personal licensee page links,
then follows those links to gather associated organizational roles and activities. The data is cleaned, structured in JSON, and limited to a subset
(e.g., first 2 firms, first 5 licensees, and first 2 organizations) to demonstrate the pipeline's functionality while managing API rate limits and complexity.


hksfc_scrape.py â†’ Saves results to hksfc_data.csv (or JSON depending on configuration inside the script)
Contains regulatory filings and notices scraped from the HK SFC website
